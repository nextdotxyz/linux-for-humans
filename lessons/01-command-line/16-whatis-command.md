So far in this course, we haveve learned quite a lot of commands. If you are ever feeling doubtful about what a command does, you can use the `whatis` command. The `whatis` command provides a brief description of command line programs:

```bash
$ whatis cat
```

The small blurb and short description you see upon running the `whatis` command is sourced from the manual page of each command.
