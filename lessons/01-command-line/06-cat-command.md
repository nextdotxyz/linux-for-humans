info> For this lesson, navigate to the **07-cat** directory.

We're almost done navigating files, but first let's learn how to read a file. The `cat` command, short for concatenate, not only displays file contents but it can also combine multiple files and show you the output of them. 

```bash
$ cat dogfile birdfile
```

It is not great for viewing large files and is only meant for short content. There are many other tools that we use to view larger text files that we'll discuss in the next lesson.
